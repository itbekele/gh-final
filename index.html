        <h1>The Rise in Anti-Black Hate Crimes</h1>
    <p>Recent FBI data highlights an increase in anti-Black hate crimes, but a lack of incident-reporting results in data that may not show the whole picture.</p>

        <p> By mid-February of 2020, residents of Satilla Shores, an idyllic subdivision in coastal Georgia, had begun to grow wary. Despite the neighborhood’s usual safeness and picturesque appearance, draped in oak branches and Spanish moss, recent events in the neighborhood had left its dwellers rattled. The past month had been marked with several property crime scares,  including a broken into car, a few stolen guns, and multiple reports of trespassing near an unfinished house on the neighborhood’s main street.
        </p>
    

        <p>It was in this waterfront neighborhood that on February 23rd, Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year Black man and frequent jogger, was murdered by three white men who claimed to have been performing a citizen’s arrest. Gregory and Travis McMichael, the armed father and son who shot Arbery, were accompanied by their neighbor William “Roddie” Bryan, who followed in his truck and filmed the event on his cellphone. Mistaken for a burglar in the neighborhood, Arbery was jogging when he was pursued by the three men in their trucks before the younger McMichael eventually exited his vehicle and fatally shot Arbery three times. 
        </p>

        
        <p>The crime went without a single arrest for more than two months, until a local radio station obtained and released Bryan’s cell phone video, which went viral and sparked national outrage. In 2021, the three perpetrators were finally charged with murder and eventually sentenced to life in prison. But it wasn’t until a subsequent federal case in February 2022, nearly two years after the murder, that a federal jury officially charged the men with committing a hate crime against Arbery. </p>
       

        <p>Following the original trial, racist text messages and social media posts by the perpetrators emerged, uncovering what many Black Americans already knew- that this crime was a racially-motivated one. In the United States, where African Americas are overwhelmingly more likely to experience hate crimes than other minorities, the ruling against Arbery’s perpetrators wasn’t just a small victory that came out of a tragedy- it was a symbolic win in the legal fight against discrimination and bias-related crimes.</p>
        

        <p>The FBI defines a hate crime as a “criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity.”  </p>

  
        <p>What is constituted as a hate crime has evolved over time in the U.S., and these cases are often difficult to prosecute. Prosecutors are tasked with not only proving that a crime occurred but also attempting to understand the state of mind and underlying intention of the defendant when they committed the crime.</p>

        <p> While most U.S. states have statutes with penalties for bias-related crimes, they vary widely in how a hate crime is defined and prosecuted. And while some states, such as California, have laws in place requiring data collection on these crimes, many don’t, leading to national hate crime data that’s incomplete and doesn’t paint a full picture of the sizable impact hate crimes have on marginalized communities. </p>
      

        
      <p>Most national hate crime data in the U.S. comes from the FBI, which collects data through their <a href=https://crime-data-explorer.app.cloud.gov/pages/home> Uniform Crime Reporting Program</a>, in addition to their National Incident-Based Reporting System. In 2020, over 15,000 law enforcement agencies submitted incident reports involving 7,759 criminal incidents motivated by bias toward race, ethnicity, ancestry, religion, sexual orientation, disability, gender, and gender identity, according to a <a href= https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/press-releases/fbi-releases-2020-hate-crime-statistics> report </a> from the FBI. </p>
       

        <p>Included in the report was a distribution of victims by bias type, showing that most single-bias hate crime incidents in 2020 were racially-motivated. Despite only making up 12.4% of the U.S. population, FBI hate crime data showed that African Americans faced more hate crimes than any other racial group in 2020. </p>

        <iframe title="Hate crime incidents by racial motivation in 2020" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-Xykl9" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Xykl9/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="332"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script> 
    

        <p>Given the historically normalized abuse of Black people in America, these results may seem unsurprising. Even still, the data is staggering when examining hate crimes against African Americans over time. In nearly every year over the past decade, anti-Black hate crimes in the U.S. have surpassed the sum of hate crimes against all other recorded racial groups.</p>

        <iframe title="Anti-Black Hate Crimes vs. Sum of all other Racial Hate Crimes" aria-label="Grouped Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-z8UPq" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/z8UPq/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="495"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

        <p>   Ananda Collins, a Political Science Ph.D. student at Syracuse University, has researched the intersection of politics and race in America, specifically studying topics such as the impact of racially traumatic events, the voting  behavior of Black youth in America, and the impact of political elites. </p>

        <p>   Collins, who grew up in the South, says that when she thinks of hate crimes, her mind immediately goes to the <a href=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/death-sentence-upheld-man-who-killed-9-south-carolina-church-n1277667> 2015 </a>shooting of a historically Black church in Charleston, South Carolina. Collins partially attributes the rise in hate crimes in America to the recent harmful rhetoric of political elites, along with an increase in political polarization. </p>

        <p> “People have tied their identities to politics, and they don’t understand how to separate it anymore,” says Collins. “When you can’t separate that, anything that attacks your political belief is going to be seen as offensive. And now people think, ‘Well I need to go to an insurrection.’ Or, ‘I need to go kill some people at a church.’ ” </p>

        <p> Across the U.S, the patchwork nature of hate crime laws at the state level results in hate crime data that is not only inconclusive but also unfair to the communities who may be eligible for more government resources if the data reporting was more robust. The National Crime Victim’s Survey, the nation’s primary federal source of information on criminal victimization, found that about <a href= https://ovc.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh226/files/ncvrw2018/info_flyers/fact_sheets/2018NCVRW_HateCrime_508_QC.pdf> half </a> of all hate crimes are not reported to the police, and only 4% of all violent hate crimes lead to arrests. </p>

        <p> Despite a lack of conclusive incident reporting, strides have been made in federal hate crime laws over the past two decades, including the <a href=https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2010/resources/hate-crime-2010-about-hate-crime> Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990 </a> and Biden’s <a href= https://www.npr.org/2021/05/20/998599775/biden-to-sign-the-covid-19-hate-crimes-bill-as-anti-asian-american-attacks-rise> recent legislation </a> against anti-Asian hate crimes during the pandemic. </p>

        <p> But until more states, cities, and police departments have increased comprehensive hate crime reporting, communities who are vulnerable to hate crimes, especially in large numbers, such as African Americans, will be left unprotected.  </p>
